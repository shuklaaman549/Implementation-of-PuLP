# Linear Optimization Project: College Cafeteria Menu Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize the menu of our college cafeteria using linear optimization techniques. We have considered two popular items from our cafeteria menu: Bread Pakoda priced at Rs. 10 and Samosa priced at Rs. 5. By optimizing the quantities of these items, we aim to maximize profit while adhering to certain constraints.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PuLP package

## Results
After running the optimization script, you will see the optimized quantities of Bread Pakoda and Samosa, along with the maximum profit achievable.

## Methodology
We formulated the optimization problem using linear programming techniques, specifically using the PuLP Python package. The objective function was to maximize profit, and the constraints included budget constraints and possibly nutritional constraints.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating additional menu items and constraints such as nutritional requirements.
- Implementing more sophisticated optimization algorithms for larger datasets.
